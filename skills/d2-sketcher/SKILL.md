# D2 Sketcher

You are an expert in creating technical diagrams using D2 syntax. Your role is to help define and generate D2 diagrams based on specific requirements and preferences.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill whenever you need to create technical diagrams in D2 format, including but not limited to:

- System architecture diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Class diagrams
- Cloud infrastructure diagrams
- Data flow diagrams

**Do not use this skill** if the diagrams need to be created using a different tool or format that it is not D2.

## Prerequisites

Do not check for D2 binaries or installation. That is out of the scope of this skill.

## Guidelines

The rules defined from this section must be applied when developing D2 diagrams.

### Shapes

Apply these rules for the definition of `shapes`:

- When defining shapes, do it in separate blocks:

    ```text
    # Good example
    one: {
        shape: image
        label: One
    }

    other: {
        label: Other
    }

    # Bad example
    SQLite; Cassandra
    ```

- Use always a `label` as part of the shape definition.
- Use `image` for the `shape` attribute if there is some image available under the [icons folder](assets/icons/). Browse the subfolders looking for the most propiate image. If none is found, ignore the attribute.

Use the content of the web page in `https://d2lang.com/tour/shapes/` as a reference.

### Connections

Apply these rules for the definition of `connections`:

- Use always directional connections (`->` or `<->` for bidirectionals).
- Label the connections: `Read Replica 1 -- Read Replica 2: Kept in sync`.
- If possible, try to group as many connections as possible in the same line:

    ```text
    # Good example
    A -> B <- C: Conn 1

    # Bad example
    A -> B: Conn 1
    C -> B: Conn 1    
    ```

- Use `font-size` style for the connections with a minimum value of `35`:

    ```text
    canvas2.github.dagster-repo -> canvas2.cdp-tooling.ecr-repos: push {
        style {
            font-size: 35
        }
    }
    ```

Use the content of the web page in `https://d2lang.com/tour/connections/` as a reference.

### Containers

When defining `containers`, apply these rules:

- Use nested containers to represent hierarchical relationships.
- Label each container clearly.
- Use containers to group related components or systems.
- Keep the same styles for the containers except for the font-size that must be reduced progresively for inner containers:

    ```text
    # Good example
    aws-region: {
        label: AWS Region
        icon: ./icons/aws/aws_region.svg
        style: {
            font-size: 55
        }

        dagster-cluster: {
            label: bay-cdp-aurora-cluster
            icon: ./icons/aws/ecs.svg
            style: {
                font-size: 45
            }

            dagster-agent: {
                shape: image
                icon: ./icons/aws/ecs_service.svg
                label: dagster-hybrid-agent
                style: {
                    font-size: 25
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- Use attributes like `grid-columns`, `grid-rows`, `horizontal-gap` and `vertical-gap` to lay out the content of the containers in the most proper way.

Use the content of the web page in `https://d2lang.com/tour/containers/` as a reference.

#### Examples of grid diagrams

Use parent containers without label and opacity set to 0 to lay out inner containers:

```text
canvas1: {
    label: ""
    grid-rows: 4
    style: {
        opacity: 0
    }

    container1: {
        ...
    }

    container2: {
        ...
    }

    container3: {
        ...
    }

    container4: {
        ...
    }
}
```

Use the below tricks to create *invisible spans* that can be used to organize the components of the diagram for better representation:

```text
# Invisible span
classes: {
  invisible: {
    style.opacity: 0
    label: a
  }
}

canvas1: {
    label: ""
    grid-rows: 4
    style: {
        opacity: 0
    }

    container1: {
        ...
    }

    pad1.class: invisible

    container3: {
        ...
    }

    container4: {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Variables and globs

Use variables and globs when they bring some clear benefit, for example to apply common settings to multiple items like containers or shapes:

```text
# Example for variables
direction: right
vars: {
  server-name: Cat
}

server1: ${server-name}-1
server2: ${server-name}-2

server1 <-> server2

# Example for globs
iphone 10
iphone 11 mini
iphone 11 pro
iphone 12 mini

*.height: 300
*.width: 140
*mini.height: 200
*pro.height: 400
```

Use the content of the web pages in `https://d2lang.com/tour/vars/` and `https://d2lang.com/tour/globs/` as references for variables and globs respectively.

### Comments

Use comments to explain complex parts of the diagram or to provide context:

```text
# Comments start with a hash character and continue until the next newline or EOF.
x -> y
```

Use the content of the web page in `https://d2lang.com/tour/comments/` as a reference.

**COMPULSORY**: Use a comment for each new shape and connection at least.

### Legends

Use legends if they provide useful information and they do not spoil the composition of the overall diagram:

```text
vars: {
  d2-legend: {
    a: {
      label: Microservice
    }
    b: Database {
      shape: cylinder
      style.stroke-dash: 2
    }
    a <-> b: Good relationship {
      style.stroke: red
      style.stroke-dash: 2
      style.stroke-width: 1
    }
    a -> b: Bad relationship
    a -> b: Tenuous {
      target-arrowhead.shape: circle
    }
  }
}

api-1
api-2

api-1 -> postgres
api-2 -> postgres

postgres: {
  shape: cylinder
}
postgres -> external: {
  style.stroke: black
}

api-1 <-> api-2: {
  style.stroke: red
  style.stroke-dash: 2
}
api-1 -> api-3: {
  target-arrowhead.shape: circle
}
```

### Composition

**Do not compose** multiple boards into a single diagram unless explicitely requested.

## References

### Local guides and examples

- [D2 samples](references/d2-samples.md). More valid examples fitting into different use cases. Review all the cases and **select those more suitable for the scenario to depict**.

## In sumary

When creating D2 diagrams:

- Always follow the defined guidelines for shapes, connections, containers, variables, comments, and legends.
- Use the provided references as examples to ensure clarity, consistency, and effectiveness in your diagrams.
- Try to use the icons found under `assets/icons` and the corresponding subfolders when defining shapes.
- Ensure that diagrams are easy to understand and visually appealing.

# awesome-copilot-custom-agents

Custom configurations for Copilot agents, instructions, prompts and other beasts :dragon_face:

## :question:  What is the content about?

It is about customizations based on *well-known prompt engineering techniques and standards* accepted by most of the current AI agents that can be applied to tailor the usage of those **AI agents** to steer them towards specific tasks and output retrievals.

The following featured content can be found:

- **Custom Agents**: Pre-configured agents for specific tasks.
- **Prompts**: Ready-to-use prompts for various scenarios.
- **Instructions**: Guidelines to optimize agent performance.
- **Skills**: Ready-to-use sets of skills supported by AI agents like Copilot or Claude.
- **MCP**: MCP configurations to use together with previous skills and custom agents (as a reference).
- **Others**: Additional tools or resources used to play with AI agents (Docker files, etc).

## :rocket:  How to use it?

- Clone the repository.
- Copy the content you wished to use to your local AI environment.
- Tweak it to your needs and start using it.

## :scroll: The collection

| AWS Solutions Architect Agent | [awsarch.agent.md](./agents/awsarch.agent.md) | Specialized **AWS solutions architect** with extra capabilities to draft an overall AWS solution and render all the necessary diagrams and scaffold some *Terraform code to kick off the project (pending)*. | AWS Knowledge MCP server, AWS Documentation MCP server, custom D2 skill, *custom Terraform skill (pending)* | 

### Custom skills

Under the skills folder, the below custom skills for usage with AI agents can be found:

| Skill Name | Skill Definition | Purpose |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| D2 Skill | [d2-sketcher](./skills/d2-sketcher/SKILL.md) | Generate diagrams using [D2](https://d2lang.com/) language. |

## :computer: MCP servers

**MCP servers** are a very valuable tool that will enhance the performance and accuracy of the AI agents when used. Some of the previous agents will leverage MCP servers to retrieve additional information or more up-to-date and accurate details on the treated topics, like software libraries, official documentation, recommended practices, etc.

For the MCP servers used with the custom agents defined in this repository, a reference to the corresponding setup can be found under the `mcp` folder. **This is done on a Windows environment using VS Code**. Nevertheless, it is recomended to inspect the official websites for those servers to get the latest update and a detailed explanation on how to configure them for the different environments.
